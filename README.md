The idea of this project was to unite people under the large umbrella of crappy movies. The world is often divided on many subjects (ones we like to avoid at the dinner table on Thanksgiving) and there are only a few things that can truly bring us together. I believe one of them, is our love to hate. And by that I mean movies we love to hate. 

We all have those movies. The movies that are an absolute guilty pleasure where we wouldn't be caught dead enjoying. A trash movie.

What if you didn't have to hide your trash away like a sneaky little Raccoon? What if you could pronounce proudly: "This is my trash! And I like it!"

Look no further than Trash or Treasure. Here you can not only post your own movie submissions, but agree with others on the quality of their trash.
